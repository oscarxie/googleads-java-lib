/**

 *             at least one of the {@code included} values.
 *             
 *             For this {@link SearchParameter}, excluded items will always take
 *             priority over included ones.
 *             
 *             This can handle a maximum of 200 (included + excluded) elements.
 *             <p>This element is supported by following {@link IdeaType}s: KEYWORD.
